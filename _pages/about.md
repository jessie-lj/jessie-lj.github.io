I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the Clinical Epidemiology and Clinical Research Center, Peking University Third Hospital. I specialize in Sciences in clinical research, with a focus on developing and applying innovative study designs to address practical clinical questions. My research interests include pragmatic trials, target trial emulation using real-world data, and evidence-based evaluation of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for effectiveness and safety.
